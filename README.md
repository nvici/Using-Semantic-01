# Using-Semantic-01
This repository is the completion of the challege-01

## Content

In this challenge, I updated the non semantic tags to semantic tags.

I also updated the photos uploaded and provided alt tags for the visually impaired

I updated CSS to link semantic elements to the Html.

Organized the CSS to follow the HTML structure for easier read on the website.
